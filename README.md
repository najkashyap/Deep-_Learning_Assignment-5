# Deep-_Learning_Assignment-5
Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks on MNIST dataset from scratch.
# Assignment Description:
Implement and train a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset.The convolution network should have a single hidden layer with multiple channels. It should achieve at least 96% accuracy on the Test Set.
#Implementation:
In my code, I defined a class CNN to represent the model and contain its parameters. I first initialize a random set of parameters, and then I use stochastic logistic regression algorithm to train the convolutional neural network model with data replacement. Then I test the data based on the training dataset to get the accuracy score. Below are the related parameters I used.
batch_size = 1
num_iterations=150000
learning_rate=0.008
stride=1
padding=0
dim_kernal=3
num_kernals=5
dim_inputs=28
input_chanl=1
len_outputs=10


I wrote 8 methods including Softmax(z), activfunc(self,Z,type = 'ReLU'), cross_entropy_error(self,v,y), forward(self,x,y), convolution(self,x,kernals),back_propagation(self,x,y,f_result), optimize(self,b_result, learning_rate), train(self, X_train, Y_train, num_iterations = 1000, learning_rate = 0.5), testing(self,X_test, Y_test) to handle initialization, model fitting and testing.

#Test Accuracy:
The test accuracy and value of loss function with respect to the number of iterations within one time of modeling are shown as follows. Note the test eventually has achieved an accuracy score of around 94%.

Trained for 30000 times, loss = NA, test = 0.9226 Trained for 60000 times, loss = NA, test = 0.9242 Trained for 90000 times, loss = NA, test = 0.9217 Trained for 120000 times, loss = NA, test = 0.9343
